Saving Code like a Professional

You just used HTML and CSS to create a portfolio.
Now (and for the rest of the nanodegree), you'll need a place to store your code so that you can easily share it with others.
In this nanodegree we will use git and GitHub to do this.

What you need to do next depends on whether or not you have a GitHub account and are fluent in the version control system git.


If you’re comfortable with git

Create a GitHub repository with the code from the project you just completed.


If you’re not comfortable with git

Note: This step applies to you even if you've used git before but are not completely comfortable.

We recommend you take Udacity's course on Version Control with Git and GitHub.

This course will teach you skills that will make you a more efficient developer who can work individually or on a large team.

When you’re comfortable with git, create a GitHub repository with the code from the project you just completed and review our Git commit message style guide.
